# A-simple-Keylogger-implemented-in-Python
The project contains the implementatin of an advanced **Keylogger** which is capable of not only capturing the **keystrokes** but also the **screenshot** whenever the user will 
**click** on any part of the screen. Each time the screenshot will be captured, all the keystrokes captured till that time along with the screenshot will be sent to the attacker's
machine through **socket programming**. In order to succeed in getting information from victim, you must start your server first and then make the victim run the keylogger code. If you want to test 
this code, you will need to change the server IP in both the files as per your machine.
